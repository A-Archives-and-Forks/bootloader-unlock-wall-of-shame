# Amazon

- Verdict: **üçÖ Terrible!**

Amazon is a weird company in the Android world. They cling onto old Android versions forever (their latest devices still ship with the EOL Android 11), they don't include Google services on their devices, and they are **extremely aggressive towards bootloader unlocks.** Even for the oldest of devices, when an exploit is discovered, Amazon will instantly patch it. There are still some exploits though, depending on your device and firmware version. Check [XDA Forums] for your specific Amazon device.
