## Global phones or Chinese phones up to ColorOS 16.0
All OnePlus phones on the global market, as well as Chinese models up to ColorOS 16.0, can be easily unlocked using the [standard procedure](../../misc/generic-unlock.md).

## Chinese phones running ColorOS 16.0 and above
According to the [OnePlus forum](https://bbs.oneplus.com/thread/1926504022886318086), for phones and tablets sold in mainland China, unlocking the bootloader is **only possible via an official application to join the “Deep Testing” program**.

**Main requirements:**  
- Account must be in good standing (no violations or restrictions)  
- No application submitted in the past 30 days  
- Device is not a corporate or carrier-customized model  

> **Note:** These restrictions currently apply only to devices sold in mainland China. However, due to the unified OPPO–OnePlus codebase, similar restrictions may be introduced for global models in the future.
