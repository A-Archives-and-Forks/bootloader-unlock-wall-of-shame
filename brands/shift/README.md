# Shift 

* Verdict **‚ÑπÔ∏è "Safe for now" :trollface:**
* [**üîìÔ∏è Unlock Guide**](../../misc/generic-unlock.md)

Shift Phones (https://shop.shiftphones.com/) can be unlocked via fastboot without any codes. The only requirement is 
to enable **OEM unlocking** in **Developer Options** settings page. This is the same procedure as on Google Pixel. Shift also provides kernel sources to allow custom ROM's as their selling point.
