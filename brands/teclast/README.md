# Teclast 

* Verdict **ℹ️ "Safe for now" :trollface:** (MediaTek)
* Verdict: **🍅 Terrible!** (Unisoc)
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide (MediaTek)**](../../misc/generic-unlock.md)


Teclast is a Chinese brand known for its budget tablets and, less commonly, Android smartphones.

Teclast follows the [standard unlock procedure](../../misc/generic-unlock.md) for their MediaTek devices. Unisoc devices cannot be unlocked, this is *not* Teclast's fault, Unisoc does not allow unlocking.

Teclast does not share the kernel source code for their devices. This is a violation of the GPLv2 license used in the Linux kernel. The lack of kernel source code severely limits the creation of custom ROMs, and can also at times make it more difficult to root or run GSIs.
