# Ulefone 

* Verdict **‚ÑπÔ∏è "Safe for now" :trollface:**
* Verdict: **üçÖ Terrible!** (Unisoc)
* [**üîìÔ∏è Unlock Guide (MediaTek)**](../../misc/generic-unlock.md)


Ulefone follows the [standard unlock procedure](../../misc/generic-unlock.md) for their MediaTek devices. Unisoc devices cannot be unlocked, this is *not* Ulefone's fault, Unisoc does not allow unlocking.

## Kernel sources
Ulefone initially **released the kernel source code for some of their early phones** (Ulefone Future, Ulefone Metal, and Power Armor 13) [on GitHub](https://github.com/ulefoneofficial?tab=repositories), although these source codes were broken, did not contain all modules, lacked proper build instructions, and all issues remained unresolved.

Since then, **they have never released any kernel source code or respond to requests [by claiming they cannot provide it](https://xdaforums.com/t/ulefone-armor-6-custom-kernel-compile-no-source-available.4553091/)**, thereby violating the terms GPL license.
